  "description" : "Patch for enhanced Storage. Addresses some duplication cases that can occur.\n\nAdditional mods supported: \nFrackin Universe (partial)\nMore Outpost Objects (partial)\nBetter Ships - Protectorate Walls (partial)\n\nStorage dissassembler no longer ejects containers that have contents.\nMannequins, capture pods, and liquid tanks no longer eject or delete 'invalid' contents\nmannequins have a short 1s cooldown to prevent a rare desync bug that can eat items.\nFixing some errors with 'denyitem' and 'quickstack' when the UI cannot detect certain container parameters\nAnything missing, help out with a pull request on Github: https://github.com/Kherae/enhancedstoragepatch\n\nPlease, do contribute. Right now, the mod has partial support for newer stuff because /supportedcontainers.config.patch requires specific values added, as indicated by the file contained in this mod (see github). You get your name on a label and some cookies!",
